Newly-Registered-Domain-Behaviour-Analysis

## Description:

This project explores the security threats posed by Newly Registered Domains (NRDs) and their association with malicious activities in cyberspace. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of NRDs using DNS-based features, entropy analysis, and graph-based visualizations via Neo4j, the project aims to identify patterns and behaviors indicative of malicious intent.

The findings highlight key traits of harmful domains and contribute to a deeper understanding of their behavior â€” providing valuable insights for improving detection strategies and enhancing proactive monitoring and verification processes.
